## Introduction

An ontology defines the language used to describe a system. In the manufacturing domain, these systems can represent a factory or plant but also enterprise applications or supply chains. There are several established ontologies in the manufacturing domain. Most of them have long been standardized. In this repository, we have focused on two of these ontologies, namely ISA95 to describe a factory ontology and IEC 63278 Asset Administration Shell to describe a manufacturing supply chain. Furthermore, we have included a factory simulation and an end-to-end solution architecture for you to try out the ontologies, leveraging IEC 62541 OPC UA and the Microsoft Azure Cloud.

### Digital Twin Definition Language

The ontologies defined in this repository are described by leveraging the Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL), which is specified [here](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md).

### International Society of Automation 95 (ISA95/IEC 62264)

ISA95 / IEC 62264 is one of the ontologies leveraged by this solution. It is a standard and described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI/ISA-95) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_62264).

### IEC 63278 Asset Administration Shell (AAS)

The IEC 63278 Asset Administration Shell (AAS) enables vendor-neutral, platform-independent data exchange along a manufacturing supply chain and leveraged by this solution. The standard is described [here](https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/EN/Standardartikel/specification-administrationshell.html). A script to convert from Asset Administration Shell models to DTDL to manually upload AAS models to Azure Digital Twins service is provided [here](https://github.com/digitaltwinconsortium/ManufacturingOntologies/tree/main/Tools/AssetAdminShell). Furthermore, the reference solution provided in this repository also contains an AAS Repository service from the Digital Twin Consortium's reference implementation [here](https://github.com/digitaltwinconsortium/AAS-Repository). This service makes the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) of the simulated products built by the simulated production lines available to customers. Please see below about how to enable this service.

### IEC 62541 Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA)

This solution leverages IEC 62541 Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) for all Operational Technology (OT) data. This standard is described [here](https://opcfoundation.org). 


## Reference Solution Architecture

This repository contains a reference solution leveraging the ontologies described above with an implementation on Microsoft Azure. Other implementations can be easily added by implementing the open interface IDigitalTwin within the UA Cloud Twin application.

:exclamation: In a real-world deployment, something as critical as opening a pressure relief valve would of course be done on-premises and this is just a simple example of how to achieve the digital feedback loop.

Here are the data flow steps:

1. The UA Cloud Publisher reads OPC UA data from each simulated factory, and forwards it via OPC UA PubSub to Azure Event Hubs. 
1. The UA Cloud Twin reads and processes the OPC UA data from Azure Event Hubs, and forwards it to an Azure Digital Twins instance. 
1. The UA Cloud Twin automatically creates digital twins in Azure Digital Twins in response, mapping each OPC UA element (publishers, servers, namespaces) to a separate digital twin.
1. Azure Data Explorer also reads and processes the OPC UA data from Azure Event Hubs and generates time series data, which can be used for analytics, such as [OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)](https://www.oee.com) calculation and predictive maintenance scenarios.


## UA Cloud Twin

The simulation makes use of the UA Cloud Twin also available from the Digital Twin Consortium [here](https://github.com/digitaltwinconsortium/UA-CloudTwin). It automatically detects OPC UA assets from the OPC UA telemetry messages sent to the cloud and registers ISA95-compatible digital twins in Azure Digital Twins service for you.

<img src="Docs/twingraph.png" alt="twingraph" width="900" />

#### Mapping OPC UA Servers to the ISA95 Hierarchy Model

UA Cloud Twin takes the combination of the OPC UA Application URI and the OPC UA Namespace URIs discovered in the OPC UA telemetry stream (specifically, in the OPC UA PubSub metadata messages) and creates OPC UA Nodeset digital twin instances (inherited from the ISA95 Work Center digital twin model) for each one. UA Cloud Publisher sends the OPC UA PubSub metadata messages to a separate broker topic to make sure all metadata can be read by UA Cloud Twin before the processing of the telemetry messages starts.

#### Mapping OPC UA PubSub Publishers to the ISA95 Hierarchy Model

UA Cloud Twin takes the OPC UA Publisher ID and creates ISA95 Area digital twin instances (derived from the digital twin model of the same name) for each one.


## A Cloud-based OPC UA Certificate Store and Persisted Storage

When running OPC UA applications, their OPC UA configuration files, keys and certificates must be persisted. While Kubernetes has the ability to persist these files in volumes, a safer place for them is the cloud, especially on single-node clusters where the volume would be lost when the node fails. This is why the OPC UA applications used in this solution (i.e. the UA Cloud Publisher, the MES and the simulated machines/production line stations) store their configuration files, keys and certificates in the cloud. This also has the advantage of providing a single location for mutually trusted certificates for all OPC UA applications.

## UA Cloud Library

The Asset Admin Shell Repository used in this reference solution reads OPC UA Information Models referenced by products described within Asset Admin Shells from the UA Cloud Library automatically. You can also read OPC UA Information Models directly from Azure Data Explorer (also used in this reference solution) and import the OPC UA nodes defined in the OPC UA Information Model into a table for lookup of additional metadata within queries. Simply run the following Azure Data Explorer query:

        let uri='https://uacloudlibrary.opcfoundation.org/infomodel/download/<insert information model identifier from cloud library here>';
        let headers=dynamic({'accept':'text/plain'});
        let options=dynamic({'Authorization':'Basic <insert your cloud library credentials hash here>'});
        evaluate http_request(uri, headers, options)
        | project title = tostring(ResponseBody.['title']), contributor = tostring(ResponseBody.contributor.name), nodeset = parse_xml(tostring(ResponseBody.nodeset.nodesetXml))
        | mv-expand UAVariable=nodeset.UANodeSet.UAVariable
        | project-away nodeset
        | extend NodeId = UAVariable.['@NodeId'], DisplayName = tostring(UAVariable.DisplayName.['#text']), BrowseName = tostring(UAVariable.['@BrowseName']), DataType = tostring(UAVariable.['@DataType'])
        | project-away UAVariable
        | take 100


## Production Line Simulation

The solution leverages a production line simulation made up of several Stations, leveraging an OPC UA information model, as well as a simple Manufacturing Execution System (MES). Both the Stations and the MES are containerized for easy deployment.

### Default Simulation Configuration

The simulation is configured to include 2 production lines. The default configuration is depicted below:

| Production Line | Ideal Cycle Time (in seconds) |
| --- | --- |
| Munich | 6 |
| Seattle |	10 |

| Shift Name | Start | End |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Morning | 07:00 | 14:00 |
| Afternoon | 15:00 | 22:00 |
| Night | 23:00 | 06:00 |

Note: Shift times are in local time, i.e. the time zone the VM hosting the production line simulation is set to!


### OPC UA Node IDs of Station OPC UA Server

The following OPC UA Node IDs are used in the Station OPC UA Server for telemetry to the cloud
* i=379 - manufactured product serial number
* i=385 - number of manufactured products
* i=391 - number of discarded products
* i=398 - running time
* i=399 - faulty time
* i=400 - status (0=station ready to do work, 1=work in progress, 2=work done and good part manufactured, 3=work done and scrap manufactured, 4=station in fault state)
* i=406 - energy consumption
* i=412 - ideal cycle time
* i=418 - actual cycle time
* i=434 - pressure

## Calculating the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)

One of the most popular use cases for the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is to make the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) of manufactured products available to customers of those products. In fact, the AAS will most likely become the underlying technology in the upcoming [Digital Product Passport (DPP)](https://circulareconomy.europa.eu/platform/en/news-and-events/all-events/eu-digital-product-passport-learning-frontrunners) initiative from the European Union. To calculate the PCF, all three scopes (1, 2 & 3) of emissions need to be taken into account. See [here](https://github.com/digitaltwinconsortium/ManufacturingOntologies#enabling-the-product-carbon-footprint-calculation-pcf-in-the-asset-admin-shell-aas-repository) about how to enable the AAS to calculate and provide the PCF to external consumers via a standardized REST interface and see [here](https://github.com/digitaltwinconsortium/ManufacturingOntologies/blob/main/Tools/MicrosoftSustainabilityManager/configuremsm.md) about how to enable the Microsoft Sustainability Manager (MSM) to calculate the PCF.

### Scope 1 Emissions

These emissions come from all sources the manufacturer uses to burn fossil fuels, either during production (for example when the manufacturer has a natural gas-powered production process) or before (for example picking up parts by truck) or afterwards (for example the cars of sales people or the delivery trucks with the produced products). They are relatively easy to calculate as the emissions from fossil fuel-powered engines are a well-understood quantity. This reference solution simply adds a fixed value for scope 1 emissions to the total product carbon footprint.

### Scope 2 Emissions

These emissions come from the electricity used during production. If the manufacturer uses a 100% renewable energy provider, the scope 2 emissions are zero. However, most manufacturers have long-term contracts with energy providers and need to ask their energy provider for the carbon intensity per KWh of energy delivered. If this data is not available, an average for the electricity grid region the manufacturing site is in should be used. This data is available through services like [WattTime](https://www.watttime.org) and this is what this reference solution uses via the built-in [Asset Admin Shell Repository](https://github.com/digitaltwinconsortium/AAS-Repository) also available open-source from the Digital Twin Consortium. Please see below on how to configure this part of the reference solution after deployment. The PCF calculation first checks if a new product was successfully produced by the production line, retrieves the produced product's serial number, followed by the energy consumption of each machine of the production line while the new product was produced by the machine and then applies the carbon intensity to the sum of all machines' energy consumption.

### Scope 3 Emissions

These emissions come from the parts and raw materials used within the product being manufactured as well as from using the product by the end customer (and getting it into the customer's hands in the first place!) and are the hardest to calculate simply due to a lack of data from the worldwide suppliers manufacturer uses today. Unfortunately, scope 3 emissions make up almost 90% of the emissions in manufacturing. However, this is where the AAS can help create a standardized interface and data model to provide and retrieve scope 3 emissions. This reference solution does just that by making an AAS available for each manufactured product built by the simulated production line and also reads PCF data from another AAS simulating a manufacturing supply chain.


## Digital Feedback Loop with UA Cloud Commander and UA Cloud Action

This reference implementation implements a "digital feedback loop", i.e. triggering a command on one of the OPC UA servers in the simulation from the cloud, based on a time-series reaching a certain threshold (the simulated pressure). You can see the pressure of the assembly machine in the Seattle production line being released on regular intervals in the Azure Data Explorer dashboard.


## Installation of Production Line Simulation and Cloud Services

Clicking on the button below will **deploy** all required resources (on Microsoft Azure):

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdigitaltwinconsortium%2FManufacturingOntologies%2Fmain%2FDeployment%2Farm.json)

Note: During deployment, you must provide a password for a VM used to host the production line simulation and for UA Cloud Twin. The password must have 3 of the following: 1 lower case character, 1 upper case character, 1 number, and 1 special character. The password must be between 12 and 72 characters long.

You can also **visualize** the resources that will get deployed by clicking the button below:

<a href="http://armviz.io/#/?load=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdigitaltwinconsortium%2FManufacturingOntologies%2Fmain%2FDeployment%2Farm.json" data-linktype="external"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/visualizebutton.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Visualize" data-linktype="external"></a>

Note: To save cost, the deployment deploys just a single Windows 11 Enterprise VM for both the production line simulation and the base OS for the Azure Kubernetes Services Edge Essentials instance. In production scenarios, the production line simulation is obviously not required and for the base OS for the Azure Kubernetes Services Edge Essentials instance, we recommend Windows IoT Enterprise Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC).

Once the deployment completes, follow these steps to setup a single-node Edge Kubernetes cluster and finish configuring the simulation:

1. Connect to the deployed Windows VM with an RDP (remote desktop) connection. You can download the RDP file in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) page for the VM, under the **Connect** options. Sign in using the credentials you provided during deployment.
1. From the deployed VM, open a **Powershell window**, navigate to the `C:\ManufacturingOntologies-main\Deployment` directory and run `New-AksEdgeDeployment -JsonConfigFilePath .\aksedge-config.json`.

Once the command is finished, your Kubernetes installation is complete and you can start deploying workloads.

Note: To get logs from all your Kubernetes workloads and services at any time, simply run `Get-AksEdgeLogs` from a **Powershell window**.


## Running the Production Line Simulation

From the deployed VM, open a **Windows command prompt**, navigate to the `C:\ManufacturingOntologies-main\Tools\FactorySimulation` directory and run the **StartSimulation** command by supplying the following parameters:

Syntax:

    StartSimulation <EventHubsCS> <StorageAccountCS> <AzureSubscriptionID>

Parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| EventHubCS | Copy the Event Hubs namespace connection string as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string). |
| StorageAccountCS | In the Azure Portal, navigate to the Storage Account created by this solution. Select "Access keys" from the left-hand navigation menu. Then, copy the connection string for key1. |
| AzureSubscriptionID | In Azure Portal, browse your Subscriptions and copy the ID of the subscription used in this solution. |
    
Example:

    StartSimulation Endpoint=sb://ontologies.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=abcdefgh= DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=ontologiesstorage;AccountKey=abcdefgh==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net 9dd2eft0-3dad-4aeb-85d8-c3adssd8127a

Note: If you have access to several Azure subscriptions, it is worth first logging into the Azure Portal from the VM through the web browser. You can also switch Active Directory tenants through the Azure Portal UI (in the top-right-hand corner), to make sure you are logged in to the tenant used during deployment. Once logged in, simply leave the browser window open. This will ensure that the StartSimulation script can more easily connect to the right subscription.

Note: In this solution, the OPC UA application certificate store for UA Cloud Publisher, as well as the simulated production line's MES and individual machines' store, is located in the cloud in the deployed Azure Storage account.


## Viewing Digital Twins in Azure Digital Twins Explorer

You can use [Azure Digital Twins Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/concepts-azure-digital-twins-explorer) to monitor twin property updates and add more relationships to the digital twins that are created. For example, you might want to add *Next* and *Previous* relationships between machines on each production line to add more context to your solution.

To access Azure Digital Twins Explorer, first make sure you have the [Azure Digital Twins Data Owner role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal#assign-the-role-using-azure-identity-management-iam) on your Azure Digital Twins instance. Then [open the explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/quickstart-azure-digital-twins-explorer#open-instance-in-azure-digital-twins-explorer).


## Generating a Digital Twins Graph with the ADT Generator Tool

You can use [ADT Generator](https://github.com/digitaltwinconsortium/ManufacturingOntologies/blob/main/Tools/ADTGenerator/Readme.md) to simplify the creation of a digital twin graph, based on the ISA95 models provided in this repository.

<img src="Docs/generator.png" alt="generator" width="900" />

To use the ADT Generator tool, first make sure you have Microsoft Excel installed, you have the production line simluation running and you have the [Azure Digital Twins Data Owner role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal#assign-the-role-using-azure-identity-management-iam) on your Azure Digital Twins instance.


## Condition Monitoring, Calculating OEE, Detecting Anomalies and Making Predictions in Azure Data Explorer

You can also visit the [Azure Data Explorer documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview) to learn how to create no-code dashboards for condition monitoring, yield or maintenance predictions, or anomaly detection. We have provided a sample dashboard in the `./Tools/ADXQueries` folder for you to deploy to the ADX Dashboard by following the steps outlined [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/azure-data-explorer-dashboards#to-create-new-dashboard-from-a-file). After import, you need to update the dashboard's data source by specifying the HTTPS endpoint of your ADX server cluster instance in the format `https://ADXInstanceName.AzureRegion.kusto.windows.net/` in the top-right-hand corner of the dashboard. 

Note: There is also an alternative calculation function for the OEE of the production line calculation provided in that folder. You should overwrite the default CalculateOEEForLine function with this one when the USE_ISA95_EQUIPMENT_MODELS environment variable is used in UA Cloud Twin.

<img src="Docs/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" width="900" />

Note: To calculate the OEE for the entire production lines, you need to set your ADT instance URL in the `CalculateOEEForLine` query. Also, you need to have the [Azure Digital Twins Data Owner role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/how-to-set-up-instance-portal#assign-the-role-using-azure-identity-management-iam) on your Azure Digital Twins instance.

Note: If you want to display the OEE for a specific shift, select `Custom Time Range` in the `Time Range` drop down in the top-left hand corner of the ADX Dashboard and enter the date and time from start to end of the shift you are interested in. 


## Using Azure Managed Grafana Service

You can also leverage Grafana to create a dashboard on Azure for this reference solution. Please see the documentation [here](https://github.com/digitaltwinconsortium/ManufacturingOntologies/blob/main/Tools/GrafanaDashboard/configuregrafana.md).

<img src="Docs/grafana.png" alt="grafana" width="900" />

## Using 3D Scenes Studio

If you want to add a 3D viewer to the simulation, you can follow the steps to configure the 3D Scenes Studio outlined [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/how-to-use-3d-scenes-studio) and map the 3D robot model from [here](https://cardboardresources.blob.core.windows.net/public/RobotArms.glb) to the digital twins automatically generated by the UA Cloud Twin:

<img src="Docs/3dviewer.png" alt="3dviewer" width="900" />

## Enabling the Product Carbon Footprint Calculation (PCF) in the Asset Admin Shell (AAS) Repository

The Asset Admin Shell (AAS) Repository is automatically configured during deployment of the reference solution, but for the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) calculation, a WattTime service account needs to be provided. Please refer to [the WattTime API documentation](https://www.watttime.org/api-documentation/#best-practices-for-api-usage) on how to register for an account. Once your account has been activated, provide your username and password in the settings of the AAS Repo website from the Azure Portal via YourDeploymentName-AAS-Repo -> Configuration -> Application settings.

## Connecting the Reference Solution to Microsoft Power BI

1. You need access to a Power BI subscription.
1. Install the Power BI Desktop app from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2240819&clcid=0x409).
1. Login to Power BI Desktop app using the user with access to the Power BI subscription.
1. From the Azure Portal, navigate to your Azure Data Explorer database instance (`ontologies`) and add `Database Admin` permissions to an Azure Active Directory user with access to just a **single** Azure subscription, i.e. the subscription used for your deployed instance of this reference solution. Create a new user in Azure Active Directory if you have to.
1. From Power BI, create a new report and select Azure Data Explorer time-series data as a data source via `Get data` -> `Azure` -> `Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)`.
1. In the popup window, enter the Azure Data Explorer endpoint of your instance (e.g. `https://erichbtest3adx.eastus2.kusto.windows.net`), the database name (`ontologies`) and the following query:

        let _startTime = ago(1h);
        let _endTime = now();
        opcua_metadata_lkv
        | where Name contains "assembly"
        | where Name contains "munich"
        | join kind=inner (opcua_telemetry
            | where Name == "ActualCycleTime"
            | where Timestamp > _startTime and Timestamp < _endTime
        ) on DataSetWriterID
        | extend NodeValue = todouble(Value)
        | project Timestamp, NodeValue

1. Click `Load`. This will import the actual cycle time of the Assembly station of the Munich production line for the last hour.
1. When prompted, log into Azure Data Explorer using the Azure Active Directory user you gave permission to access the Azure Data Explorer database earlier.
1. From the `Data view`, select the NodeValue column and select `Don't summarize` in the `Summarization` menu item.
1. Switch to the `Report view`.
1. Under `Visualizations`, select the `Line Chart` visualization.
1. Under `Visualizations`, move the `Timestamp` from the `Data` source to the `X-axis`, click on it and select `Timestamp`.
1. Under `Visualizations`, move the `NodeValue` from the `Data` source to the `Y-axis`, click on it and select `Median`.
1. Save your new report.

Note: You can add other data from Azure Data Explorer to your report similarily.

## A Turn-Key Alternative: Microsoft Fabric

[Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview) is an all-in-one analytics solution that covers everything from data movement to data science, analytics, and business intelligence. It offers a comprehensive suite of services, including data lake, data engineering, and data integration, all in one place. You don't even need an Azure subscription for it, let alone deploy or manage any apps or services. As a simpler alternative to the reference solution provided in this repository, you can get started with Microsoft Fabric [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial).

<img src="Docs/fabric.png" alt="fabric" width="900" />

To configure Microsoft Fabric for production line data, you need at least 1 OPC UA server integrated into your produciton line that support OPC UA PubSub. Alternatively, you can use an OPC UA Client/Server to OPC UA PubSub adapter app like UA Cloud Publisher used in this reference solution. Then follow these steps:

1. Log into Microsoft Fabric [here](https://fabric.microsoft.com).
1. Create a `KQL Database` by clicking `Create` -> `See all` -> `KQL Database` and give it a name, e.g. `kql_db_opcua`. Click `Create`.
1. Under `Database details`, edit the `OneLake folder` setting and set it to `Active`. This will enable sharing your OPC UA time-series data from your production line within your organization via [OneLake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-overview) in [Parquet file format](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/). Click `Done`.
1. Create the tables you need for ingesting the OPC UA PubSub production line data by clicking `Check your data`, deleting the sample data in the text box and by entering the following Kusto command, one at a time and then clicking `Run` for each line:

        .create table opcua_raw(payload: dynamic)

        .create table opcua_metadata_raw (payload: dynamic) 

        .create table opcua_raw ingestion json mapping "opcua_mapping" @'[{"column":"payload","path":"$","datatype":"dynamic"}]'

        .create table opcua_metadata_raw ingestion json mapping "opcua_metadata_mapping" @'[{"column":"payload","path":"$","datatype":"dynamic"}]'

        .create table opcua_intermediate(DataSetWriterID: string, Timestamp: datetime, Payload: dynamic)

        .create table opcua_telemetry (DataSetWriterID: string, Timestamp: datetime, Name: string, Value: dynamic)

        .create table opcua_metadata (DataSetWriterID: string, Name: string) 

1. Create the OPC UA PubSub production line data parsing functions, by entering the following function definitions, one at a time, clicking `Run` for each line:

        .create-or-alter function OPCUARawExpand() {
            opcua_raw
            |mv-expand records = payload.Messages
            | where records != ''
            |project 
              DataSetWriterID = tostring(records["DataSetWriterId"]),
              Timestamp = todatetime(records["Timestamp"]),
              Payload = todynamic(records["Payload"])
         }

         .create-or-alter function OPCUADatasetExpand() {
            opcua_intermediate
            | mv-apply Payload on (
                extend key = tostring(bag_keys(Payload)[0])
                | extend p = Payload[key]
                | project Name = key, Value = todynamic(p.Value)
            )
        }

        .create-or-alter function OPCUAMetaDataExpand() {
            opcua_metadata_raw
            | project DataSetWriterId = tostring(payload.DataSetWriterId), Name = tostring(payload.MetaData.Name)
        }

1. Apply the OPC UA PubSub parsing functions to your tables, by entering the following policy updates, one at a time, clicking `Run` for each line:
 
        .alter table opcua_intermediate policy update @'[{"Source": "opcua_raw", "Query": "OPCUARawExpand()", "IsEnabled": "True"}]'

        .alter table opcua_telemetry policy update @'[{"Source": "opcua_intermediate", "Query": "OPCUADatasetExpand()", "IsEnabled": "True"}]'

        .alter table opcua_metadata policy update @'[{"Source": "opcua_metadata_raw", "Query": "OPCUAMetaDataExpand()", "IsEnabled": "True"}]'

1. Create a "Last Known Value" OPC UA PubSub metadata table to make sure you always use the latest metadata available, by entering the following materialized view definition and clicking `Run`:

        .create materialized-view opcua_metadata_lkv on table opcua_metadata
        {
            opcua_metadata
            | extend iTime = ingestion_time()
            | summarize arg_max(iTime, *) by Name, DataSetWriterID
        }

1. Create an `Eventstream` by clicking `Create` -> `See all` -> `Eventstream` and give it a name (e.g. `eventstream_opcua_telemetry`). Click `Create`. This component will receive the OPC UA PubSub production line telemetry and send it to your KQL database.
1. Click `New source` and select `Custom App` and give it a name (e.g. `opcua_telemetry`). Click `Add`. In the `Information` box, click on `Connection string-primary key` and copy it. You will need it soon when configuring UA Cloud Publisher.
1. Create another `Eventstream` by clicking `Create` -> `See all` -> `Eventstream` and give it a name (e.g. `eventstream_opcua_metadata`). Click `Create`. This component will receive the OPC UA PubSub production line metadata and send it to your KQL database.
1. Click `New source` and select `Custom App` and give it a name (e.g. `opcua_metadata`). Click `Add`. In the `Information` box, click on `Connection string-primary key` and copy it. You will need it soon when configuring UA Cloud Publisher.
1. Now configure UA Cloud Publisher. You can either follow the steps for connecting your own production line described [here](https://github.com/digitaltwinconsortium/ManufacturingOntologies#replacing-the-production-line-simulation-with-a-real-production-line) or you can modify the configuration of the UA Cloud Publisher setup in the production line simulation provided in this repository, for example for the Munich production line. For the latter, follow these steps:
   1. Log into the VM deployed with this reference solution, open a **Powershell window** and run `Get-AksEdgeNodeAddr` as well as `kubectl get services -n munich`.
   1. Open a browser on the VM and enter the IP address and port retrieved for UA Cloud Publisher in the previous step in the address field (e.g. `http://192.168.0.2:30356`) to access the UA Cloud Publisher UI.
   1. In the UA Cloud Publisher UI, click `Configuration` and enter the `Connection string-primary key` from the `opcua_telemetry` custom app you copied earlier into the `Broker Password` field, enter `$ConnectionString` into the `Broker Username` field, enter the `EntityPath` into the `Broker Message Topic` (the entity path is contained at the end of the connection string and starts with "es_") and the name of your custom app into the `Broker URL` field (the custom app name is contained within the connection string and starts with `eventstream-` and ends with `.servicebus.windows.net`).
   1. Select the checkbox `Use Alternative Broker For OPC UA Metadata Messages` and enter the `Connection string-primary key` from the `opcua_metadata` custom app you copied earlier into the `Alternative Broker Password` field, enter `9093` in the `Alternative Broker Port` field, enter `$ConnectionString` into the `Alternative Broker Username` field, enter the `EntityPath` into the `Broker Metadata Topic` (the entity path is contained at the end of the connection string and starts with "es_") and the name of your custom app into the `Alternative Broker URL` field (the custom app name is contained within the connection string and starts with `eventstream-` and ends with `.servicebus.windows.net`).
   1. Set the `Metadata Send Interval in Seconds` to `3000`.

        <img src="Docs/publisherconfig.png" alt="publisherconfig" width="900" />

   1. Click `Apply` at the top of the configuration page.

## Connecting the Reference Solution to On-Premises SAP Systems

Note: If you want to simply try out SAP connectivity before connecting your real SAP system, you can deploy an `SAP S/4 HANA Fully-Activated Appliance` to Azure from [here](https://cal.sap.com/catalog#/applianceTemplates) and use that instead.

The Azure services handling connectivity to your on-premises SAP systems is called Azure Logic Apps. Azure Logic Apps is a no-code Azure service to orchestrate workflows that can trigger actions in e.g. Azure Digital Twins service.

### Configuring Azure Logic Apps to Receive Data From On-Premises SAP Systems

To create a new Azure Logic Apps workflow from your on-premises SAP system to Azure Logic Apps and further on to your Azure Digital Twins service instance and also store the data sent from SAP in your Azure Storage Account deployed in this reference solution, follow these steps:

1. Deploy an instance of Azure Logic Apps in the same region you picked during deployment of this reference solution via the Azure Portal. Select the consumption-based version.
1. Once deployed, go to the resource, select `Identity` and enable `System assigned`. Click on `Azure Role Assignments` -> `Add role assignment`. Select `Resource Group` for `Scope`, your subscription name for `Subscription`, the resource group you have picked during the deployment of this reference solution for `Resource Group` and `Azure Digital Twin Data Owner` for `Role`. Click `Save`.
1. From the Azure Logic App Designer, select the trigger template `When a HTTP request is received`.
1. Select `+ New step`, select `Azure File Storage` and select `Create file`. Give the connection a name and select the storage account name of the Azure Storage Account deployed for this reference solution. For `Folder path`, enter `sap`, for `File name` enter `IDoc.xml` and for `File content` select `Body` from the dynamic content. In the Azure Portal, navigate to your storage account deployed in this reference solution, select `Storage browser`, select `File shares` and select `Add file share`. Enter `sap` for the name and select `Create`.
1. Hover over the arrow between your trigger and your create file action, select the `+` button and select `Add a parallel branch`. Select `Azure Digital Twins` and add the action `Add Twin` from the list of Azure Digital Twins actions available. Specify the ADT instance (host) name of your Azure Digital Twins service instance deployed in this reference solution. Click the `Connect with managed identity` field, give it a name, specify the ADT instance (host) name of your Azure Digital Twins service instance deployed in this reference solution in the `ADT Instance Name` field and make sure `System-assigned managed identity` is selected for `Managed identity`. Click `Create`. Click on the `Digital twin id` field and enter `sap`. Then select `Add new parameter` and select `Request`. In the new Request field, enter  `{ "$metadata": { "$model": "dtmi:digitaltwins:isa95:JobOrder;1" }, "description": { "$metadata": {} }, "tags": { "$metadata": {} } }`.
1. Save your workflow.
1. Select `Run Trigger` and wait for the run to complete. Verify that there are green check marks on all three components of your workflow. If you see any red exclamation marks, select the component for more info regardig the error.

Your completed Azure Logic Apps workflow should now look like this:

### Microsoft On-Premises Data Gateway

Microsoft provides an on-premises data gateway for sending data **to** on-premises SAP systems from Azure Logic Apps.

Note: To receive data **from** on-premises SAP systems to Azure Logic Apps in the cloud, the SAP connector and on-premises data gateway is **not** required.

To install the on-premises data gateway, follow these steps:

1. Download and install the on-premises data gateway from [here](https://aka.ms/on-premises-data-gateway-installer). Pay special attention to the [prerequisits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install#prerequisites)! For example, if your Azure account has access to more than one Azure subscription, you need to use a different Azure account to install the gateway and to create the accompanying on-premises data gateway Azure resource. Simply create a new user in your Azure Active Directory if this is the case.
1. If not already installed, download and install the Visual Studio 2010 (VC++ 10.0) redistributables from [here](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcredist_x64.exe).
1. Download and install the SAP Connector for Microsoft .NET 3.0 for Windows x64 from [here](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/msnet.html?anchorId=section_512604546). SAP download access for the SAP portal is required. Contact SAP support if you don't have this.
1. Copy the 4 libraries libicudecnumber.dll, rscp4n.dll, sapnco.dll and sapnco_utils.dll from the SAP Connector's installation location (by default this is `C:\Program Files\SAP\SAP_DotNetConnector3_Net40_x64`) to the installation location of the data gateway (by default this is `C:\Program Files\On-premises data gateway`).
1. Restart the data gateway through the `On-premises data gateway` configuration tool that came with the on-premsis data gateway installer package installed earlier.
1. Create the on-premises data gateway Azure resource in the same Azure region as selected during the data gateway installation in the previous step and select the name of your data gateway under `Installation Name`.

<img src="Docs/gateway.png" alt="gateway" width="500" />

Note: Further background info regarding the configuration steps can be accessed [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-using-sap-connector?tabs=consumption).

Note: If you run into errors with the Data Gateway or the SAP Connector, you can enable debug tracing by following [these steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/david_burgs_blog/enable-sap-nco-library-loggingtracing-for-azure-on-premises-data-gateway-and-the-sap-connector).


## Replacing the Production Line Simulation with a Real Production Line

Once you are ready to connect your own production line, simply delete the VM from the Azure Portal.

1. Edit the UA-CloudPublisher.yaml file provided in the `Deployment` folder of this repository, replacing [yourstorageaccountname] with the name of your Azure Storage Account and [key] with the key of your Azure Storage Account. You can access this information from the Azure Portal on your deployed Azure Storage Account under Access keys.
1. Run UA Cloud Publisher with the following command. The edge PC hosting UA Cloud Publisher needs Kubernetes support and Internet access (via port 9093) and needs to be able to connect to your OPC UA-enabled machines in your production line:

        kubectl apply -f UA-CloudPublisher.yaml

Note: On Azure Kubernetes Services Edge Essentials, you can get the IP address of your Kubernetes cluster by running `Get-AksEdgeNodeAddr` from a **Powershell window**.

Note: You can query for the external Kubernetes port of your UA Cloud Publisher service by running `kubectl get services -n <namespace>` from a **Powershell window**.

<img src="Docs/publisher.png" alt="publisher" width="900" />

1. Open a browser on the Edge PC and navigate to http://[IPAddressOfYourKubernetesCluster]:[KubernetesPortOfYourPublisherService]. You are now connected to the UA Cloud Publisher's interactive UI. Select the Configuration menu item and enter the following information, replacing [myeventhubsnamespace] with the name of your Event Hubs namespace and replacing [myeventhubsnamespaceprimarykeyconnectionstring] with the primary key connection string of your Event Hubs namespace. The primary key connection string can be read in the Azure Portal under your Event Hubs' "share access policy" -> "RootManagedSharedAccessKey". Then click `Apply`:
  
        PublisherName: "UACloudPublisher",
        BrokerUrl: "[myeventhubsnamespace].servicebus.windows.net",
        BrokerPort: 9093,
        BrokerUsername: "$ConnectionString",
        BrokerPassword: "[myeventhubsnamespaceprimarykeyconnectionstring]",
        BrokerMessageTopic: "data",
        BrokerMetadataTopic: "metadata",
        SendUAMetadata: true,

## Enabling Automatic Asset Onboarding with Azure OpenAI Service

For your real production line, you can enable automatic asset onboarding for your industrial assets with a fixed data model (e.g. energy meters, valves, pumps etc.) via Azure OpenAI Service, UA Edge Translator and UA Cloud Publisher, by following these steps:

1. Deploy an instance of Azure OpenAI Service in the Azure Portal.
1. Deploy a Large Language Model to your Azure Open AI Service instance, GPT-4 is recommended for best results.
1. Configure UA Cloud Publisher deployed for your own production line to use your Azure OpenAI instance via its built-in user interface.
1. Deploy UA Edge Translator on a PC with Kubernetes support located in the same network as your industrial asset and UA Cloud Publisher. You can use the UA-EdgeTranslator.yaml file from the `Deployment` folder of this repository by calling `kubectl apply -f UA-EdgeTranslator.yaml`.
1. Create a Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description using the Azure OpenAI Service via the UA Cloud Publisher's user interface and send it to UA Edge Translator.
